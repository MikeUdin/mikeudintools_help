## Activation

Before you can use the plugin it needs to be activated. After the purchase you will be given a license key, which you need to enter at the first launch of the plugin. If the license key only activates one computer, you must deactivate the key on the previous computer to reactivate it. To do this, on the **Info tab**, click _**About > Manage License > Deactivate**_.

After that, the key is ready for activation on the new computer. If you cannot deactivate the previous installation, please contact [here](https://mikeudin.net/about/) for support.
