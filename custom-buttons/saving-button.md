# Saving button

Each button that can be created using the **Custom Buttons** plug-in is a python script. To save the script, click on **Save** or **Save as** and specify script name.

It is very important that the scripts must be located here

_**Win: c:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\MAXON\CINEMA 4D \(your version\)\library\scripts**_

_**Mac:**_ **/Users/**_**%USERNAME%**_**/Library/Preferences/Maxon/Maxon Cinema 4D**_**\(your version\)**_**/library/scripts**

In this directory, you can distribute scripts to subdirectories. In addition to the script file, the plug-in creates additional files containing preset data. Please, don't delete or move it. Without these files, the button will not work.

After saving, you'll need to restart **Cinema 4D**. To do it quickly just open plugin window menu  **Edit &gt; Restart Cinema 4D.** The saved script button will be available in the **Script &gt; User** **scripts** Cinema 4D ****menu. For convenience, you can place it on the toolbar or assign a hotkey.
