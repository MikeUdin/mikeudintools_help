# How it works

Go to the menu **Plug-ins > Custom Buttons**. In a new window, you will see main elements intended to create your first user preset.

Drop Zone **(1)** is designed for dragging and dropping objects or parameters there.

In the text box **(2)**, you can put a button description or any other comments.

Icon box **(3)** is intended to create an image file, which will be saved with the script as an icon.
