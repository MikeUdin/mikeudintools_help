**Flash Buffer for Cinema 4D** is a plugin that helps you to create _Object Buffer_ passes when you need to prepare scene for rendering. With this plug-in you can also quickly and easily assign the available passes, delete unnecessary ones, or select objects which they are assigned to. **Rename** function will help specify the names of the results of rendering passes, as well as to distribute conviniently all the sequences on the subdirectories.
