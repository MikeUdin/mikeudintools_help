Unlike traditional fonts with fixed styles, variable fonts allow for seamless adjustments along various axes, such as weight, width, and slant. This versatility enables designers to create custom font variations tailored to specific design needs, providing greater creative freedom.

With variable fonts, multiple font styles can be consolidated into a single file, reducing the file size and enhancing performance. This efficiency is particularly advantageous for web design, where optimizing page loading times is crucial.

The flexibility of variable fonts extends to animations and interactivity. Designers can animate font attributes smoothly, allowing for engaging and dynamic typography effects. This adds a layer of visual interest and enhances user experience in interactive applications.
