# TakeMatPass

Surprisingly, **Cinema 4D** does not natively allow the output of materials in separate passes, either as a white mask or as each material represented in different colors. **TakeMatPass** is a plug-in for **Cinema 4D R17 and higher** that can create an additional Take with a mask of the material/object/texture tag that can be output as a **Color ID** pass or multiple white masks.
