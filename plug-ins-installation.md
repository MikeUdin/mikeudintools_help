# Plug-ins Installation

### Quick Installation

The ZIP File you downloaded contains a plug-in folder. Close the **Cinema 4D** application and copy the content of the plug-in folder into your **Cinema 4D's** plug-ins folder.

**Windows:** c:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\MAXON\CINEMA 4D \(version whatever\)\plugins\

**Mac:** Applications &gt; Maxon &gt; Cinema 4D \(version whatever\) &gt; plugins\

Now start application again.

### Detailed Installation

Unpack the downloaded ZIP file into a temporary location of your choice \(e.g. your Desktop\). Inside the ZIP file you find a plug-in folder that contains all the files that need to be copied to your **Cinema 4D** installation.

Find **Cinema 4D's** plugin folder: To find the folder where **Cinema 4D** expects 3rd party plug-ins start **Cinema 4D** and go to the preferences \(from the **Edit &gt; Preferences** menu\). You can see the path to the preferences folder at the bottom of the dialog. There is also a button to open the folder in the File Explore/Finder. Click the **"Open Preferences Folder..."** button.

The path on **Windows** is typically something like: C:\Users\Name\AppData\Roaming\MAXON\CINEMA 4D Version\

The path on **Mac OS** is typically something like: /Users/Name/Library/Preferences/MAXON/CINEMA 4D Version/

Close the Cinema 4D Application.

Copy the plug-in files: In the preferences folder you see a folder named plug-ins. Now copy all the files from the downloaded plugin folder into that plug-ins folder. Start **Cinema 4D** again. Now plug-in should be installed and working. To make sure everything went fine you can check the Console in Cinema 4D. Use the **Script &gt; Console...** menu to open the Console. You should find a message showing that the plug\*in has been loaded.
